backbone-project-manager
========================

Web app to track logs, bugs and specs for individual clients/projects built using backbone, underscore,
twitter bootstrap and slim.

Dependencies: Twitter Bootstrap, Backbone.js, Underscore.js, Slim, Backbone.js, Jquery-ui (for tabs... 
switching to bootstrap's tabs soon).

Create a MySQL database named pmgr_demo (or change the database name in index.php to someting else) 
and import the included sql file.

The interface and data fields are very rudimentary.  I just wanted to get a basic backbone application
working.  This is merely a base from which to build a more thorough project management system.  Although even
in its current state it has proven useful in keeping track of my various client projects.
